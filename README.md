## Introduction to AAI's Github Repository
Welcome to SIT AAI's github repository.

In this repository, projects and resources from previous batches of AAI students and helpful study materials are passed on in hopes to foster a positive learning environment to reinforce our foundational skills

Each individual topic has its own markdown which will include reading materials, project examples and fundamental knowledge required to start picking up on the topic.
