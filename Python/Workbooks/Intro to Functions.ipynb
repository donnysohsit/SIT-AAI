        "We have crossed one huge hurdle and currently am now in the final section in our introduction to python section of software engineering. Today we are going to start talking about something called functions. This is our first taste of programming methodology and is one of the first instances we get exposed to a form of programming known as functional programming. What functions mean is that they allow us to pack a list of statements together.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, let's assume the following. You may need to drive from one place to another during Chinese New Year (while observing social distancing rules of course). If you are driving a manual car, there are a set of instructions you need to observe. For example you need to maintain a half clutch position as you are moving off from start. You need to step on the clutch while you are changing gears, and you also need to remember when you should be changing gears.\n",
        "\n",
        "This set of instructions can be considered to be abstracted with a semi-automatic car. In a sumi-automatic car, you no longer need to be concerned with the many steps, but you have full confidence that all the steps required in changing the gear are managed by the car and you just need to press the up or the down button to change up or change down the gear.\n",
        "\n",
